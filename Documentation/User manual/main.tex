\section{Introduction}
\textit{game name} is for the travelling gamer who desires a challenge during his/her daily commute. We offer several exciting stages to conquer with a variation of difficulty. You take the role of an adventurer ready to explore the lands and reach the end goal of traveling the lands and all the danger within them. The game is in the style of a classic 2D side controller fashion where the player travels along the landscape. The stage is completed by reaching the goal at the end of the stage.
